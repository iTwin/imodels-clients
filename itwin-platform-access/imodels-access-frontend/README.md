## About this package

This package contains an implementation of [`FrontendHubAccess`](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/blob/master/core/frontend/src/FrontendHubAccess.ts) interface. The implementation uses the [`@itwin/imodels-client-management`](../../clients/imodels-client-management/README.md) package and adapts it to the defined interface thus enabling the applications built using [iTwin.js](http://www.itwinjs.org) library to use [iModelHub service](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/#imodelhubservice) as a repository for iModels.
