## About this package

This package contains an implementation of [`BackendHubAccess`](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/blob/master/core/backend/src/BackendHubAccess.ts) interface. The implementation uses [`@itwin/imodels-client-authoring`](../../clients/imodels-client-authoring/README.md) package and adapts it to the defined interface thus enabling the applications built using [iTwin.js](http://www.itwinjs.org) platform to use [iModels API](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels/) for iModel storage.
