# iModels API clients

<span style="color:red">TODO: what is this</span>. Please visit the [iModels API documentation page](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels/) on iTwin developer portal to learn more about the iModels service and its APIs. API clients contain methods that either act as a thin wrapper for sending a single request to the API or combine several requests to execute a more complex operation.

iModels API is a part of [iTwin Platform](https://developer.bentley.com/). iTwin platform together with an open source [iTwin.js](https://www.itwinjs.org/) library provides capabilities for creating, querying, modifying, and displaying Infrastructure Digital Twins.
